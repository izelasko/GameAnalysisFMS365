                        <p>
                            It Takes Two is a co-op adventure game, centered around two main characters. May and Cody, the aforementioned characters, are the only two options for players to choose at the start of the game. Players can switch characters throughout the game, as the interface allows for the players to choose their character every time a saved game is opened. This is an interesting mechanic that may be important to investigate when thinking about player agency in the game. The two players must go through the entirety of the game together, completing challenges in tandem. The challenges are often, if not always, impossible to do with one player. This requires a certain degree of cooperation and collaboration, in order to complete the various stages. These mechanics make up a very interesting game that has many moving parts that make it such an immersive play experience. <br><br>
                            The game is animated in a 3D, semi-realistic style, or at least the environment is. Cody and May, once transformed into their cartoon forms, are a bit different. The two are turned into doll-sized figures, and remain that way for the entirety of the game. Cody’s design goes from being a human with human flesh, to being a figurine of sorts, made of clay. On the other hand, May’s design goes from being a human to being a figurine made of yarn. The difference in the two materials between the two characters is, essentially, indicative of their difference in character and personality. Cody is the less strict, malleable of the two, while May is more structured and intricate, much like a yarn project. The game world mirrors that of the real world. The house is filled with things that you would typically find in a home. Where things differ is that the players are shrunken down to the size of dolls, while the house stays the same. This transports the players into the game world. <br><br>
                            The game is meant to cover a typically difficult topic in a way that is unconventional. The players are so easily immersed in the game that they are able to focus more on the collaborative aspects of the gameplay than the main issue between Cody and May: their failing marriage. The players get to step into the “magic circle” that Sam Von Ehren and many other game study scholars discuss. Inside the circle, players take on a role, typically different than their usual, everyday ones. This is what draws people to play games in the first place; people get to step outside of their own lives and become someone else for a while. Inside the “magic circle” of games like It Takes Two, players are able to explore the game world with the ability to be able to leave whenever they want. (Von Ehren 2). In this game, we get to experience life as Cody and/or May, but when we want to, we can leave, and return to our own lives. <br><br>
                            The game is largely designed to inspire connection between the two players involved in any instance of the game, due to its co-op mechanics. One of the things that can be difficult in terms of playing a cooperation-based game is that two people aren’t always going to be the same type of player. One player may want to rush through the story, and get to all of the action, while another may want to hang back and explore the environment a bit more. Bartle Player Taxonomy defines four major player types: killers, achievers, explorers, and socializers. Each type contains multitudes of different characteristics, ones that are specific to certain players. (Zenn 2). The fact that no two players fall in the same category is what makes It Takes Two a bit tricky. No two humans are impervious to conflict occurring at some point in their lives, and this applies directly to this game. The players may face issues when their player types clash, and one wants to move forward faster than the other, or one is taking things more seriously than the other. The social facet of this game is something so incredibly important to the gameplay experience; it simply cannot be understated.

                        <h1>Gameplay</h1>

                        <p>
                            The game is available on PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC. Wherever users decide to play, the only real requirement is that you have two players. When playing with a controller, the game controls are like that of any other adventure/action game; the left stick is for movement, the right is for camera control, etc. The players must go through many obstacles in order to complete the ultimate goal: getting back to Cody and May’s daughter, Rose. The game places the players in all sorts of different challenging situations, which require the players to collaborate their movements in order to move forward. Doors can be opened, objects can be inspected, and items can be picked up. Throughout the game, the players will gain (and later, lose) abilities and weapons, such as flight, a goo-gun, nail-throwing, and a hammer. These abilities and tools are crucial to gameplay, as most of the challenges cannot be completed without them. For example, when there is a gap that May cannot cross, Cody is able to throw a nail into the wall for May to grapple off of. Likewise, when there is somewhere Cody cannot jump to, May can use the hammer to launch Cody into the air and onto a platform. These activities require both players to interact with the environment and with each other in order to move forward within the game’s story. <br><br>
	                        The level of interactivity within the game is fairly high, keeping players engaged and wanting to learn more about the story. While you can interact with a lot of different things in the game, you don’t necessarily have a lot of agency over the story. The story stays the same over the course of the game, regardless of the small choices you make during gameplay, such as deciding whether or not to complete the mini-games. The characters will always encounter the “Book of Love,” Dr. Hakim, and will always follow a path that leads to Cody and May’s eventual return back to Rose. Interactivity is more about having a conversation, in this case, with the game itself. Chris Crawford’s take on this is that for something to be interactive, there has to be two parties interacting. By this he means that there is an input, computation, and an output. There is something that happens between when the player completes an action and the return of the visual change in the environment: the computer thinks (Salen and Zimmerman 3). After this happens, the player gets feedback. In the case of this particular game, the feedback is typically in the form of simply being able to move forward, a door opening, or an obstacle being moved out of the way. The feedback the players receive is fairly instantaneous, once they complete a task. This satisfies the human brain, as we like the feeling of instant gratification. This drives the players to keep completing tasks and missions in the game.

                        <h1>Narrative</h1>

                        <p>
                            The narrative factors of It Takes Two are very intriguing. The players are easily lost in the fun nature of the minigames and side-quests, yet the narrative is still intact and clearly moving in the same direction. In Videogames and Narrative, Sebastian Domsch explains that games themselves aren’t narratives, but they contain multitudes of smaller narratives(Domsch 3). This is true of It Takes Two, as the players can identify many different narratives that make up the overarching one that encompasses all. The main narrative is one where two parents are struggling in their marriage. Some of the smaller narratives involved are: Rose’s emotional journey that leads to her leaving home, Cody and May’s self discovery journeys, and the various critters’ importance in the garden. These separate narrative journeys are interconnected in that they all interact to make up the main, overarching narrative. Cody and May’s problems and discoveries lead to Rose wanting to leave home, and the impact of the critters’ stories affects Cody and May’s personal emotions towards themselves and others around them. There are no parts of this game that are not, in some way, tied to something larger. Even when you think something is small, it has effects that will allow things to change later on in the game. <br><br>
	                        One of the main narrative pieces to the game revolves around Cody and May, and their respective issues as people. The two are fairly simple characters, in theory, but they have their differences and personal flaws that make their relationship so complex and turbulent. The way in which the game goes about portraying their relationship is primarily through cutscenes and general dialogue. Domsch explains that one extremely effective way of carrying out narratives is through dialogue between playable characters and between characters and NPCs (Domsch 10). When players are directly involved in the dialogue, they are easily able to follow the narrative being portrayed without zoning out. Cody and May’s relationship issues are directly depicted through their vocal arguments and their tough, yet sometimes comical, interactions with Dr. Hakim. They clash with each other in conversation enough for the player to be able to pick up on the tension. <br><br>
	                        The second narrative that is clearly portrayed in It Takes Two is the emotional change that children go through as they begin to become aware of the emotions of people around them. This is what happens to Rose, as she begins to notice, and be affected by, her parents’ failing marriage. She clearly has an emotional response to their arguments, as the whole reason Cody and May turn into dolls is because Rose’s tears fall onto the Book of Love. This visualization of Rose’s emotional state from an outsider’s perspective allows for the players to easily understand how her emotional maturity changes from the beginning of the story to the end. Most of the exposition that occurs relating to Rose happens in cut scenes, which are notoriously helpful to pushing forward specific narratives, because of their lack of player agency during them. <br><br>
	                        When playing through the part of the game that occurs outdoors, the players interact with many different creatures and critters, such as bees, wasps, squirrels, fish, and more. Though these creatures are typically the source of many obstacles in the game, the narrative moves towards explaining that these critters are valuable to the world that the characters live in. The queen bee ends up helping Cody and May, after she makes their lives exponentially harder twenty minutes beforehand, in a different space. The squirrels end up being quite handy to have as friends later in the game, after they make Cody and May fight the wasps. This narrative explains that the critters outside can actually be friends, and that wildlife is an important part of any environment. <br><br>
	                        Overall, It Takes Two may not seem like it holds very many narratives, but when investigating a little further, one may find that it actually holds multitudes. There are even narratives within the game that were not touched on in this discussion, but talked about by game scholars such as Xin Yao in the paper Video Gaming and Narratives of Love as a potential stance of cultural-political meaning in current societies: A study of It Takes Two, 2021 . Yao’s research touches more on how video games such as this one should be viewed as cultural artifacts, and it is a good read!

                        <p>
                            The design elements in this game support the different narratives in many ways. The main design choice, though, that affects the players’ experience is the way environmental storytelling is employed. The entire game is an example of environmental storytelling, as Cody and May move through their home that was once so full of love. The items set aside/broken such as the cuckoo clock and the snow globe become parts of the game, as the players must move through obstacles relating to them. Once the challenges are completed, the items are fixed, and Rose is shown recognizing this. Damien Lawardorn explains that, “environmental storytelling has lost ground over the last few years, becoming less prominent as a way of contributing to video game stories, but it is a genie that cannot be put back into its bottle”(Lawardorn 4). Lawardorn goes into detail about the changes in use of environmental storytelling since BioShock in 2007, to more “recent” applications like Gone Home and The Last of Us. It Takes Two fits into this discussion, as the game world that was carefully created plays a huge role in how the players come to understand the life of Cody, May, and Rose. The garage with all of May’s building materials, which go unused, explains how May doesn’t get to her fun projects as often anymore, because of how much she stresses over her job. The greenhouse with all of the overgrown and diseased plants explains how Cody doesn’t pursue his passion of gardening anymore, so things have decayed over time. Both of these examples are ways that the game designers explicitly used the environment to make a point about the narrative they were trying to portray. In this case, the narrative examines Cody and May’s personal issues, and how they impact and stress their relationship.<br><br> 
	                        Perhaps the other most evident game design element that portrays the narrative is the co-op mechanics, and how collaboration is pivotal in being able to complete the different chapters. The challenges being impossible to complete without two players indicates that relationships cannot be saved with only one individual putting in the work. This ties into the narrative that depicts Cody and May’s issues, while also implying another narrative altogether. This new narrative has to do with the challenges couples face when trying to better their relationships, and the stressors that can make healing more difficult for all parties involved. Playing through the game, the players are forced to come to the understanding that they simply will not get anywhere without the other player, so they must collaborate. <br><br>
	                        The kind of player experience in It Takes Two is one that not all games are able to achieve. The game inherently fosters conversation, as players must communicate in order to solve puzzles and defeat bosses. Players must compromise sometimes in order to make meaningful choices. In Meaningful Choice in Games, Brice Morrison explains that choices in-game can translate to real-world emotions and reactions. He discusses the four pillars of meaningful choice: awareness, consequences, reminders, and permanence (Morrison 3). The choices that the two players make in this game are almost always permanent, and the individuals are made very clear that they are making some sort of decision. The consequences of some of these choices result in having to start the section over, or sometimes even death of the character (though they respawn, don’t worry!). A game that is full of so many fun obstacles and interactions may often be overlooked as something containing such meaningful choices, but that should not be the case with It Takes Two.
